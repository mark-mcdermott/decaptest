I completed my Masters in Software Engineering at Texas State in June 2022. Prior to school I had worked building websites (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) for several companies; had worked QA for a Fortune 500 company, and a startup which went public while I was there and had worked one devops position (setting up Jenkins CI/CD and writing tests in Java). In school I studied C, C++, Java, Python and Bash. On my own over the years I've learned some Node, Mongo, Angular, and React. Since school, I've been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails and Vue. Outside of work, I love riding my Peloton, listening to lofi music and spending time with my family.

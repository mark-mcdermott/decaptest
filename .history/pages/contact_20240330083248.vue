      <h2>Mentoring</h2>
      <p>I have a sort of open offer to teach anyone who wants to learn to code, for free. Although I'm still not where I want to be, I've now worked in quite a few programming languages for quite awhile. I've had quite a bit of help along the way and have helped some others the way I was helped. I find it works best when folks are really, really hungry to learn — like ready to grind and to not sleep for the next decade kind of hungry. If that's you, hit me up.</p>
